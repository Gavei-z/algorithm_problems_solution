# Some of my algorithm problems' solution

I guess I've written a few hundred algorithm problems so far, but many of the files I had written before were lost.

Here are some of them.

- The files with name starting with number, such as `1006SignInAndSignOut`, are the problems in the website of PAT. 
- Meanwhile, those files with name starting with `acw` or just `a`, such as `acw3432`, are the problems in the website of ACWing.

**There are still about one hundred LeetCode problems' solution to be put in. I will do it later.(2023.02.22)**
